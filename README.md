# Rusty Vite

A SvelteKit project, powered by [`rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [`@wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wasm-tool/rollup-plugin-rust).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
